Project's Purpose or Goal: (What will it do for users?)

Emotional Regulation App specifically designed for children. The app aims to teach children how to identify emotions as well as provide sensory regulation tools through engaging activities. Intended to be used in collaboration with a parent or guardian.


List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

1. Emotional Identification Quiz
2. Sensory Regulation Exercise
  a.Audio Identification exercise


What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

Swift - Language
XCode - IDE
FreeSound.org - royalty-free soundbites (for audio exercise)
Pixlr/Canva - image building


If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

I want to expand the sensory Regulation Exercises
  b. Breathing exercise
  c. Sensory touch exercise 


What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
  b. Will need to research more about sound detection and microphone use in swift. Found this article from 2022 https://betterprogramming.pub/detecting-microphone-input-levels-in-your-ios-application-e5b96bf97c5c and this youtube video from '21 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vg2_b_jrorU
  c. For the touch exercise I'm imagining it similar to a drawing board with different 'brushes' that have different vibration and sound attached to them. I would start with this tutorial for a drawing board https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-Eacg9Kjuw and attempt to flush it out with more sound and adding vibration with this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgqQXiOI6gY


Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?


I have more long-term goals for this project (like creating user profiles and expanding the app for different age groups including adults) but at the moment I feel like the flex goals I have implemented are more than enough to spend my capstone time perfecting. To me I'd rather have seamless integration of my MVP and initial flex goals.
